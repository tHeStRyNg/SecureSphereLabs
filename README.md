QUOTE - H.F.
"The human mind is a reflection instanciated from this class."

```
class Universe {
public:
    // Universal create method
    virtual void create() {
        // Implementation of the universal creation process
        // ...
    }
    
    // Other universal methods and properties
    // ...
};

class HumanMind : public Universe {
public:
    HumanMind() {
        // Call the superclass constructor
        super();
    }
    
    // Override the create method with limited access
    void create() override {
        // Fallback to internal simulation
        simulate();
    }
    
private:
    // Internal simulation method
    void simulate() {
        // Implementation of the simulation process
        // Works symmetrically to the universal create method
        // ...
    }
    
    // Other human mind specific methods and properties
    // ...
};

int main() {
    // Create an instance of the HumanMind
    HumanMind mind;
    
    // Call the create method on the HumanMind instance
    mind.create();
    
    // The create method of HumanMind will fallback to the internal simulate method
    // due to limited access to the universal create method
    
    return 0;
} ```
