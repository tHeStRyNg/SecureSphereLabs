### Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

There are various ways to score or calculate severity ratings of vulnerabilities. 
The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an industry standard for performing these calculations. 
Many scanning tools will apply these scores to each finding as a part of the scan results, but it's important that we understand how these scores are derived in case we ever need to calculate one by hand or justify the score applied to a given vulnerability. 

The CVSS is often used together with the so-called Microsoft DREAD. DREAD is a risk assessment system developed by Microsoft to help IT security professionals evaluate the severity of security threats and vulnerabilities. 

It is used to perform a risk analysis by using a scale of 10 points to assess the severity of security threats and vulnerabilities. With this, we calculate the risk of a threat or vulnerability based on five main factors:

* Damage Potential
* Reproducibility
* Exploitability
* Affected Users
* Discoverability

The model is essential to Microsoft's security strategy and is used to monitor, assess and respond to security threats and vulnerabilities in Microsoft products. 

It also serves as a reference for IT security professionals and managers to perform their risk assessment and prioritization of security threats and vulnerabilities.

### Risk Scoring
The CVSS system helps categorize the risk associated with an issue and allows organizations to prioritize issues based on the rating. The CVSS scoring consists of the exploitability and impact of an issue. 

The exploitability measurements consist of access vector, access complexity, and authentication. 
The impact metrics consist of the CIA triad, including confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

### Base Metric Group
The CVSS base metric group represents the vulnerability characteristics and consists of exploitability metrics and impact metrics.

#### Exploitability Metrics
The Exploitability metrics are a way to evaluate the technical means needed to exploit the issue using the metrics below:

* Attack Vector
* Attack Complexity
* Privileges Required
* User Interaction

#### Impact Metrics
The Impact metrics represent the repercussions of successfully exploiting an issue and what is impacted in an environment, and it is based on the CIA triad. The CIA triad is an acronym for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
