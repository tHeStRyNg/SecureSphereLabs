### Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)

#### Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL)
Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) is a publicly available information security international standard used to evaluate and detail the system's current state and issues. 

OVAL is also co-supported by the office of Cybersecurity and Communications from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. 

OVAL provides a language to understand encoding system attributes and various content repositories shared within the security community. 

The OVAL repository has over 7000+ definitions for public use. 
Additionally, OVAL is also used by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) which brings together community ideas for automating vulnerability management, measurement, and ensuring systems meet policy compliance.
