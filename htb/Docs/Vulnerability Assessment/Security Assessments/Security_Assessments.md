### Security Assessments

Every organization must perform different types of Security assessments on their networks, computers, and applications at least every so often. The primary purpose of most types of security assessments is to find and confirm vulnerabilities are present, so we can work to patch, mitigate, or remove them. There are different ways and methodologies to test how secure a computer system is. Some types of security assessments are more appropriate for certain networks than others. But they all serve a purpose in improving cybersecurity. All organizations have different compliance requirements and risk tolerance, face different threats, and have different business models that determine the types of systems they run externally and internally. Some organizations have a much more mature security posture than their peers and can focus on advanced red team simulations conducted by third parties, while others are still working to establish baseline security. Regardless, all organizations must stay on top of both legacy and recent vulnerabilities and have a system for detecting and mitigating risks to their systems and data.

### Vulnerability Assessment
Vulnerability assessments are appropriate for all organizations and networks. A vulnerability assessment is based on a particular security standard, and compliance with these standards is analyzed (e.g., going through a checklist).

A vulnerability assessment can be based on various security standards. Which standards apply to a particular network will depend on many factors. These factors can include industry-specific and regional data security regulations, the size and form of a company's network, which types of applications they use or develop, and their security maturity level.

Vulnerability assessments may be performed independently or alongside other security assessments depending on an organization's situation.

### Penetration Test
Here at Hack The Box, we love penetration tests, otherwise known as pentests. Our labs and many of our other Academy courses focus on pentesting.

They're called penetration tests because testers conduct them to determine if and how they can penetrate a network. A pentest is a type of simulated cyber attack, and pentesters conduct actions that a threat actor may perform to see if certain kinds of exploits are possible. The key difference between a pentest and an actual cyber attack is that the former is done with the full legal consent of the entity being pentested. Whether a pentester is an employee or a third-party contractor, they will need to sign a lengthy legal document with the target company that describes what they're allowed to do and what they're not allowed to do.

As with a vulnerability assessment, an effective pentest will result in a detailed report full of information that can be used to improve a network's security. All kinds of pentests can be performed according to an organization's specific needs.

Black box pentesting is done with no knowledge of a network's configuration or applications. Typically a tester will either be given network access (or an ethernet port and have to bypass Network Access Control NAC) and nothing else (requiring them to perform their own discovery for IP addresses) if the pentest is internal, or nothing more than the company name if the pentest is from an external standpoint. This type of pentesting is usually conducted by third parties from the perspective of an external attacker. Often the customer will ask the pentester to show them discovered internal/external IP addresses/network ranges so they can confirm ownership and note down any hosts that should be considered out-of-scope.

Grey box pentesting is done with a little bit of knowledge of the network they're testing, from a perspective equivalent to an employee who doesn't work in the IT department, such as a receptionist or customer service agent. The customer will typically give the tester in-scope network ranges or individual IP addresses in a grey box situation.

White box pentesting is typically conducted by giving the penetration tester full access to all systems, configurations, build documents, etc., and source code if web applications are in-scope. The goal here is to discover as many flaws as possible that would be difficult or impossible to discover blindly in a reasonable amount of time.

Often, pentesters specialize in a particular area. Penetration testers must have knowledge of many different technologies but still will usually have a specialty.

Application pentesters assess web applications, thick-client applications, APIs, and mobile applications. They will often be well-versed in source code review and able to assess a given web application from a black box or white box standpoint (typically a secure code review).

Network or infrastructure pentesters assess all aspects of a computer network, including its networking devices such as routers and firewalls, workstations, servers, and applications. These types of penetration testers typically must have a strong understanding of networking, Windows, Linux, Active Directory, and at least one scripting language. Network vulnerability scanners, such as Nessus, can be used alongside other tools during network pentesting, but network vulnerability scanning is only a part of a proper pentest. It's important to note that there are different types of pentests (evasive, non-evasive, hybrid evasive). A scanner such as Nessus would only be used during a non-evasive pentest whose goal is to find as many flaws in the network as possible. Also, vulnerability scanning would only be a small part of this type of penetration test. Vulnerability scanners are helpful but limited and cannot replace the human touch and other tools and techniques.

Physical pentesters try to leverage physical security weaknesses and breakdowns in processes to gain access to a facility such as a data center or office building.

* Can you open a door in an unintended way?
* Can you tailgate someone into the data center?
* Can you crawl through a vent?

Social engineering pentesters test human beings.

* Can employees be fooled by phishing, vishing (phishing over the phone), or other scams?
* Can a social engineering pentester walk up to a receptionist and say, "yes, I work here?"

Pentesting is most appropriate for organizations with a medium or high security maturity level. Security maturity measures how well developed a company's cybersecurity program is, and security maturity takes years to build. It involves hiring knowledgeable cybersecurity professionals, having well-designed security policies and enforcement (such as configuration, patch, and vulnerability management), baseline hardening standards for all device types in the network, strong regulatory compliance, well-executed cyber incident response plans, a seasoned CSIRT (computer security incident response team), an established change control process, a CISO (chief information security officer), a CTO (chief technical officer), frequent security testing performed over the years, and strong security culture. Security culture is all about the attitude and habits employees have toward cybersecurity. Part of this can be taught through security awareness training programs and part by building security into the company's culture. Everyone, from secretaries to sysadmins to C-level staff, should be security conscious, understand how to avoid risky practices, and be educated on recognizing suspicious activity that should be reported to security staff.

Organizations with a lower security maturity level may want to focus on vulnerability assessments because a pentest could find too many vulnerabilities to be useful and could overwhelm staff tasked with remediation. Before penetration testing is considered, there should be a track record of vulnerability assessments and actions taken in response to vulnerability assessments.

### Vulnerability Assessments vs. Penetration Tests

Vulnerability Assessments and Penetration Tests are two completely different assessments. Vulnerability assessments look for vulnerabilities in networks without simulating cyber attacks. All companies should perform vulnerability assessments every so often. A wide variety of security standards could be used for a vulnerability assessment, such as GDPR compliance or OWASP web application security standards. A vulnerability assessment goes through a checklist.

* Do we meet this standard?
* Do we have this configuration?

During a vulnerability assessment, the assessor will typically run a vulnerability scan and then perform validation on critical, high, and medium-risk vulnerabilities. This means that they will show evidence that the vulnerability exists and is not a false positive, often using other tools, but will not seek to perform privilege escalation, lateral movement, post-exploitation, etc., if they validate, for example, a remote code execution vulnerability.

Penetration tests, depending on their type, evaluate the security of different assets and the impact of the issues present in the environment. Penetration tests can include manual and automated tactics to assess an organization's security posture. They also often give a better idea of how secure a company's assets are from a testing perspective. A pentest is a simulated cyber attack to see if and how the network can be penetrated. Regardless of a company's size, industry, or network design, pentests should only be performed after some vulnerability assessments have been conducted successfully and with fixes. A business can do vulnerability assessments and pentests in the same year. They can complement each other. But they are very different sorts of security tests used in different situations, and one isn't "better" than the other.
