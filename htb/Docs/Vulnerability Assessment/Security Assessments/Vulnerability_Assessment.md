### Vulnerability Assessment

A Vulnerability Assessment aims to identify and categorize risks for security weaknesses related to assets within an environment. It is important to note that there is little to no manual exploitation during a vulnerability assessment. A vulnerability assessment also provides remediation steps to fix the issues.

The purpose of a Vulnerability Assessment is to understand, identify, and categorize the risk for the more apparent issues present in an environment without actually exploiting them to gain further access. Depending on the scope of the assessment, some customers may ask us to validate as many vulnerabilities as possible by performing minimally invasive exploitation to confirm the scanner findings and rule out false positives. Other customers will ask for a report of all findings identified by the scanner. As with any assessment, it is essential to clarify the scope and intent of the vulnerability assessment before starting. Vulnerability management is vital to help organizations identify the weak points in their assets, understand the risk level, and calculate and prioritize remediation efforts.

It is also important to note that organizations should always test substantial patches before pushing them out into their environment to prevent disruptions.

### Methodology

Below is a sample vulnerability assessment methodology that most organizations could follow and find success with. Methodologies may vary slightly from organization to organization, but this chart covers the main steps, from identifying assets to creating a remediation plan.
