### Vulnerability Assessment

A Vulnerability Assessment aims to identify and categorize risks for security weaknesses related to assets within an environment. It is important to note that there is little to no manual exploitation during a vulnerability assessment. A vulnerability assessment also provides remediation steps to fix the issues.

The purpose of a Vulnerability Assessment is to understand, identify, and categorize the risk for the more apparent issues present in an environment without actually exploiting them to gain further access. Depending on the scope of the assessment, some customers may ask us to validate as many vulnerabilities as possible by performing minimally invasive exploitation to confirm the scanner findings and rule out false positives. Other customers will ask for a report of all findings identified by the scanner. As with any assessment, it is essential to clarify the scope and intent of the vulnerability assessment before starting. Vulnerability management is vital to help organizations identify the weak points in their assets, understand the risk level, and calculate and prioritize remediation efforts.

It is also important to note that organizations should always test substantial patches before pushing them out into their environment to prevent disruptions.

### Methodology

Below is a sample vulnerability assessment methodology that most organizations could follow and find success with. Methodologies may vary slightly from organization to organization, but this chart covers the main steps, from identifying assets to creating a remediation plan.

### Understanding Key Terms
Before we go any further, let's identify some key terms that any IT or Infosec professional should understand and be able to explain clearly.

#### Vulnerability
A Vulnerability is a weakness or bug in an organization's environment, including applications, networks, and infrastructure, that opens up the possibility of threats from external actors. Vulnerabilities can be registered through MITRE's Common Vulnerability Exposure database and receive a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score to determine severity. This scoring system is frequently used as a standard for companies and governments looking to calculate accurate and consistent severity scores for their systems' vulnerabilities. Scoring vulnerabilities in this way helps prioritize resources and determine how to respond to a given threat. Scores are calculated using metrics such as the type of attack vector (network, adjacent, local, physical), the attack complexity, privileges required, whether or not the attack requires user interaction, and the impact of successful exploitation on an organization's confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. Scores can range from 0 to 10, depending on these metrics.

For example, SQL injection is considered a vulnerability since an attacker could leverage queries to extract data from an organization's database. This attack would have a higher CVSS score rating if it could be performed without authentication over the internet than if an attacker needed authenticated access to the internal network and separate authentication to the target application. These types of things must be considered for all vulnerabilities we encounter.

#### Threat
A Threat is a process that amplifies the potential of an adverse event, such as a threat actor exploiting a vulnerability. Some vulnerabilities raise more threat concerns over others due to the probability of the vulnerability being exploited. For example, the higher the reward of the outcome and ease of exploitation, the more likely the issue would be exploited by threat actors.

#### Exploit
An Exploit is any code or resources that can be used to take advantage of an asset's weakness. Many exploits are available through open-source platforms such as Exploit-db (https://www.exploit-db.com/) or the Rapid7 Vulnerability and Exploit Database (https://www.rapid7.com/db/). We will often see exploit code hosted on sites such as GitHub and GitLab as well.

#### Risk
Risk is the possibility of assets or data being harmed or destroyed by threat actors.

To differentiate the three, we can think of it as follows:

* Risk: something bad that could happen
* Threat: something bad that is happening
* Vulnerabilities: weaknesses that could lead to a threat

Vulnerabilities, Threats, and Exploits all play a part in measuring the level of risk in weaknesses by determining the likelihood and impact. For example, vulnerabilities that have reliable exploit code and are likely to be used to gain access to an organization's network would significantly raise the risk of an issue due to the impact. If an attacker had access to the internal network, they could potentially view, edit, or delete sensitive documents crucial for business operations. We can use a qualitative risk matrix to measure risk based on likelihood and impact with the table shown below.

In this example, we can see that a vulnerability with a low likelihood of occurring and low impact would be the lowest risk level, while a vulnerability with a high likelihood of being exploited and the highest impact on an organization would represent the highest risk and would want to be prioritized for remediation.
