### Packet Analysers
A packet analyzer, also known as packet sniffer, protocol analyzer, or network analyzer,is a computer program or computer hardware such as a packet capture appliance that can analyze and log traffic that passes over a computer network or part of a network.

Packet capture is the process of intercepting and logging traffic.

As data streams flow across the network, the analyzer captures each packet and, if needed, decodes the packet's raw data, showing the values of various fields in the packet, and analyzes its content according to the appropriate RFC or other specifications.
